TESTING METHODS
_________________
New graph created.
isEmpty() Expect true. Got: true
Testing addVertex()
isEmpty() Expect false. Got: false
Printing graph with 4 verices and no arcs. 
Got:
Vertices: 
[A, B, C, D]

Arcs: 
from A: []
from B: []
from C: []
from D: []

Testing addArc()
Printing graph with vertices [A, B, C, D) and arcs: A->B, A->C, B->A, C->B. 
Got:
Vertices: 
[A, B, C, D]

Arcs: 
from A: [B, C]
from B: [A]
from C: [B]
from D: []

Testing removeVertex()
try remove invalid vertex
Expect vertices [A, B, C, D] and arcs: A->B, A->C, B->A, C->B. 
Got:
Vertices: 
[A, B, C, D]

Arcs: 
from A: [B, C]
from B: [A]
from C: [B]
from D: []

try remove valid vertex w 2 arcs
Expect vertices [B, C, D] and arcs: C->B. 
Got:
Vertices: 
[B, C, D]

Arcs: 
from B: []
from C: [B]
from D: []

try remove vertex w no arcs
Expect vertices [B, C] and arcs: C->B. 
Got:
Vertices: 
[B, C]

Arcs: 
from B: []
from C: [B]

try remove vertex from empty graph
Expect vertices [] and arcs: . 
Got:
Graph is empty
