TESTING METHODS
_________________
New graph created.
isEmpty() Expect true. Got: true

Testing addVertex()
isEmpty() Expect false. Got: false
Printing graph with 4 verices and no arcs. 
Got:
Vertices:
[A, B, C, D]
Arcs:
from A: []
from B: []
from C: []
from D: []

Testing addArc()
New graph has (4):4 vertices and (4):4 arcs
Printing graph with vertices [A, B, C, D] and arcs: A->B, A->C, B->A, C->B. 
Got:
Vertices:
[A, B, C, D]
Arcs:
from A: [B, C]
from B: [A]
from C: [B]
from D: []

isEdge A <--> B? (TRUE) true
isEdge C <--> B? (FALSE) false
isArc A --> C? (TRUE) true
isArc B --> C? (FALSE) false
isArc B --> D? (FALSE) false

Saving the graph into A-D.tgf

Testing addEdge()
add an edge between B and D
Expect vertices [A, B, C, D] and arcs: A->B, A->C, B->A, B->D, C->B, D->B
Got:
Vertices:
[A, B, C, D]
Arcs:
from A: [B, C]
from B: [A, D]
from C: [B]
from D: [B]


Testing removeEdge()
try remove the edge between B and D
Expect vertices [A, B, C, D] and arcs: A->B, A->C, B->A, C->B. 
Got:
Vertices:
[A, B, C, D]
Arcs:
from A: [B, C]
from B: [A]
from C: [B]
from D: []


Testing removeVertex()
try remove invalid vertex
Expect vertices [A, B, C, D] and arcs: A->B, A->C, B->A, C->B. 
Got:
Vertices:
[A, B, C, D]
Arcs:
from A: [B, C]
from B: [A]
from C: [B]
from D: []

try remove valid vertex A w 2 arcs
Expect vertices [B, C, D] and arcs: C->B. 
Got:
Vertices:
[B, C, D]
Arcs:
from B: []
from C: [B]
from D: []

try remove vertex D w no arcs
Expect vertices [B, C] and arcs: C->B. 
Got:
Vertices:
[B, C]
Arcs:
from B: []
from C: [B]

try remove vertex from empty graph
Expect vertices [] and arcs: . 
Got:
Vertices:
[]
Arcs:
